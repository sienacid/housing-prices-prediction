# housingprices
Using a publicly accessible dataset from Kaggle, I conducted an analysis to predict housing prices in Mexico City. The project was completed in Python and includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Techniques such as linear regression and regularization (Ridge) were applied to build predictive models.
